# 📱 MOBILE PRICING ISSUE - WORKAROUND GUIDE

## ❌ The Problem
SimpleSwap detects mobile devices **server-side** using HTTP headers that JavaScript cannot modify. This means:
- All client-side spoofing attempts fail
- Service workers can't modify the initial request headers
- The €21 pricing is applied before our code runs

## ✅ Working Solutions

### Option 1: Desktop Browser Mode 🖥️
Most mobile browsers have a "Desktop Site" option:
1. Open Chrome/Safari on mobile
2. Tap menu (⋮ or ⋯)
3. Enable "Desktop site" or "Request desktop site"
4. Navigate to the payment page
5. SimpleSwap should show €19.50

### Option 2: Use Widget URL 🔧
The widget interface might have different pricing:
```
https://widget.simpleswap.io/?from=eur-eur&to=pol-matic&amount=19.50&provider=mercury
```

### Option 3: Manual Override 📝
1. Let SimpleSwap load with €21
2. Manually change the amount field to €19.50
3. Click on Mercury provider to select it
4. Proceed with payment

### Option 4: Desktop Computer 💻
Simply use a desktop/laptop computer to complete the purchase

## 🔍 Why Spoofing Failed

1. **Server-Side Detection**: SimpleSwap checks the `User-Agent` HTTP header on their server
2. **Browser Security**: Browsers prevent JavaScript from modifying HTTP headers
3. **Incognito Mode**: Service workers are disabled in incognito mode
4. **Loading Bug**: The "fix" you saw was just the Polygon conversion getting stuck

## 🚀 Recommended Approach

Since we can't bypass server-side detection, the best approach is:

1. Update the mobile experience to show a message explaining the €21 pricing
2. Provide clear instructions to use desktop mode or a computer
3. Offer the widget URL as an alternative

Would you like me to implement this more honest approach that acknowledges the limitation and guides users to working solutions?
