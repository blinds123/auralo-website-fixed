## 🚨 Important Findings

### 🔍 Cross-Origin Script Injection Limitation

**Finding:** The Mercuryo forcing script does NOT automatically inject from auralo-website-fixed.netlify.app to simpleswap.io due to browser security policies (CORS/Content Security Policy).

**Impact:** This is actually a **POSITIVE security feature** that prevents unauthorized script injection.

**Solution Architecture:** The current deployment serves multiple integration methods:

1. **🎯 Direct Integration** - Script can be integrated directly into SimpleSwap pages
2. **🔖 Bookmarklet Version** - Users can manually activate the script
3. **🔌 Browser Extension** - Future deployment option for maximum control
4. **📋 Testing Interface** - Available at auralo-website-fixed.netlify.app/test-script.html
