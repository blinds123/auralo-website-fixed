# 🎯 PRP Implementation Guide: Complete Mobile Pricing Solution

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive Product Requirements Prompt (PRP) solution addresses the SimpleSwap mobile pricing discrimination issue through a multi-layered business approach. After extensive research confirming that technical workarounds are impossible (server-side detection), we've developed a robust business solution framework.

## 🔍 Problem Analysis Complete

### Root Cause Confirmed ✅
- **SimpleSwap detects mobile devices SERVER-SIDE** using HTTP User-Agent headers
- **JavaScript cannot modify these headers** before server processing
- **€19.50 → €21.00 price increase** is applied at server level
- **Mercury provider selection** is affected by mobile detection

### Technical Solutions Exhaustively Tested ❌
- Client-side JavaScript spoofing: **FAILED**
- Service worker header modification: **FAILED**  
- Proxy/redirect approaches: **FAILED**
- URL parameter attempts: **FAILED**
- Pre-render proxy implementations: **FAILED**

### Working Solutions Identified ✅
1. **Desktop mode in mobile browser** (user enables manually)
2. **Desktop computer usage** (100% reliable)
3. **Business compensation solutions** (rebate system)
