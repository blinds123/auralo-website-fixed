# Auralo Website Deployment Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Carousel Navigation Buttons on Mobile
**Issue:** Navigation buttons were far apart on mobile (one on each side) instead of together like desktop
**Fix Applied:** Updated mobile CSS to match desktop layout:
- Changed `justify-content: space-between` to `justify-content: flex-start`
- Added `gap: 4px` to match desktop spacing
- Removed absolute left/right positioning
- Made buttons same size and style as desktop (50x50px, 18px font, rounded corners)

### 2. Blue Dots (Hotspots) Not Showing on Mobile
**Issue:** 8 blue interactive dots in "Your Life, Elevated" section not visible on mobile
**Fix Applied:** Enhanced mobile hotspot visibility:
- Added `opacity: 1 !important` to ensure visibility
- Added `pointer-events: auto !important` for interaction
- Already had proper z-index and display settings

### 3. 14-Second Timer Popup
**Issue:** Timer popup might not be showing or closable
**Analysis:** The popup code exists and has proper close functionality:
- Close button (×) at top right
- "Got it, I'll decide fast!" button also closes popup
- Both use `onclick="this.closest('.xl-simple-popup').remove()"`
- Mobile-specific CSS ensures popup shows with `position: fixed !important`

## Root Cause of Deployment Issues

The disconnect between code and live site is likely due to:

1. **Browser Caching:** Users may have cached old versions
2. **CDN Caching:** Netlify or CloudFlare may be caching old files
3. **Service Worker:** If present, may serve old cached content

## Deployment Solution

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Force Cache Bust:**
   - Add version query parameter to index.html URL: `?v=3.1`
   - Or rename file to index-v3.html temporarily

2. **Clear Netlify Cache:**
   - In Netlify dashboard: Deploys → Trigger Deploy → Clear cache and deploy site

3. **Update Cache Headers:**
   ```toml
   [[headers]]
     for = "*.html"
     [headers.values]
       Cache-Control = "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"
       Pragma = "no-cache"
       Expires = "0"
   ```

### For Users:
Tell users to:
1. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. Clear browser cache for the site
3. Try incognito/private mode to verify fixes work

### Verification Steps:
1. Deploy the updated index.html
2. Wait 2-3 minutes for propagation
3. Test in incognito mode first
4. Check mobile device in incognito
5. Verify:
   - Carousel buttons are together
   - Blue dots appear in images
   - Timer popup shows after 14 seconds
   - Popup can be closed

## Testing Locally
```bash
# Run local server to test
cd /Users/nelsonchan/auralo-fix
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Open http://localhost:8000
```

## Summary
All code fixes have been applied. The main issue is likely caching preventing the updated code from being served. Follow the deployment solution steps to ensure changes propagate to all users.
