# üü¢ MERCURYO GREEN BORDER SOLUTION - FINAL

## Problem Clarification ‚úÖ
You were right - I was looking for the wrong thing! The issue is about which provider has the **GREEN BORDER** around it, not a checkmark.

## Key Discovery üîç
After analyzing desktop vs mobile behavior:

### Desktop Behavior:
- SimpleSwap gives Mercuryo the **GREEN BORDER** by default for EUR transactions
- No mobile app prompts
- Touch events don't exist
- Larger screen size

### Mobile Behavior:
- SimpleSwap shows Mercuryo but gives **GREEN BORDER to MoonPay**
- Even with EUR currency
- Mobile detection overrides provider preference

## Root Cause üéØ
SimpleSwap detects mobile devices through:
1. User Agent (iPhone, Android, Mobile)
2. Touch Events (`ontouchstart` in window)
3. Screen Size (width < 768px)
4. Device Pixel Ratio (high DPR)
5. Media Queries (pointer: coarse, hover: none)

## FINAL SOLUTION üíö

### Complete Mobile Detection Override:
```javascript
// Override ALL mobile indicators
- User Agent ‚Üí Desktop Windows Chrome
- Platform ‚Üí Win32
- Touch Events ‚Üí Completely removed
- Screen ‚Üí 1920x1080
- Device Pixel Ratio ‚Üí 1
- Media Queries ‚Üí Desktop responses
```

### Visual Experience:
- Green gradient background (matches Mercuryo)
- "FORCING MERCURYO GREEN BORDER" message
- Shows override status
- Redirects to SimpleSwap with desktop experience

## How It Works üîß

1. **Mobile Device Visits Site** ‚Üí Clicks "Buy Now"
2. **Green Loading Screen** ‚Üí Shows override status
3. **Complete Desktop Transformation** ‚Üí All mobile indicators removed
4. **SimpleSwap Loads** ‚Üí Thinks it's desktop
5. **Mercuryo Gets GREEN BORDER** ‚Üí Selected by default!

## Testing Required üì±

Test on REAL devices (not just resized browsers):
- ‚úÖ iPhone 12 Pro
- ‚úÖ iPhone 14
- ‚úÖ Samsung Galaxy
- ‚úÖ Google Pixel
- ‚úÖ iPad
- ‚úÖ Android Tablets

**Look for:** GREEN BORDER around Mercuryo provider card

## Alternative If This Fails üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Direct Mercuryo Integration** - Bypass SimpleSwap completely
2. **Server Proxy** - Route mobile traffic through desktop server
3. **Contact SimpleSwap** - Request partner control over provider selection

## Bottom Line üíØ

The solution transforms your mobile device into a desktop from SimpleSwap's perspective, ensuring Mercuryo gets the GREEN BORDER selection instead of MoonPay.
