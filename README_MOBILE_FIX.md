# 📱 Mobile €21 Fix - Complete Solution Package

## 🎯 The Problem
SimpleSwap shows €21 instead of €19.50 on mobile phones because they detect mobile devices **on their server** using HTTP headers that JavaScript cannot modify.

## ✅ The Solution
**Enable "Desktop Mode" in your mobile browser** - this is the ONLY reliable fix.

## 📦 Files Included

### Core Files (Upload These)
1. **`index.html`** - Main landing page (updated to redirect mobile users)
2. **`desktop-mode-guide.html`** - Clear guide for enabling desktop mode
3. **`test-desktop-mode.html`** - Test page to verify desktop mode is working

### Alternative Attempts (Also Upload)
- `force-desktop-mode.html` - Ultra aggressive spoofing attempt
- `simpleswap-widget-fix.html` - Alternative payment methods
- `sw-ultimate.js` - Service worker attempt
- `proxy-redirect.html` - Redirect attempt
- Other spoofing attempts

## 🚀 How to Deploy
1. Upload the entire `auralo-website-fixed` folder to Netlify
2. The system will automatically detect mobile users
3. Mobile users get redirected to the desktop mode guide
4. Once they enable desktop mode, they get €19.50 pricing

## 🧪 How to Test
1. Open site on mobile phone
2. Click "Buy Now"
3. You'll see the desktop mode guide
4. Enable desktop mode in your browser
5. Use `test-desktop-mode.html` to verify it's working
6. Proceed to payment - should show €19.50

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- **Incognito mode**: Service workers don't work, use regular mode
- **The loading bug**: Was not a real fix, just broken Polygon conversion
- **Client-side spoofing**: Does NOT work - SimpleSwap detects server-side
- **Only real fix**: Desktop mode or use a computer

## 📱 Desktop Mode Instructions

### Chrome/Android
1. Tap menu (⋮)
2. Check "Desktop site"
3. Page reloads with desktop version

### Safari/iPhone  
1. Tap "aA" button in address bar
2. Select "Request Desktop Website"
3. Page reloads with desktop version

### Firefox/Android
1. Tap menu (⋮)
2. Toggle "Desktop site"
3. Page reloads with desktop version

## 💡 Why Other Solutions Failed
- SimpleSwap checks the User-Agent HTTP header on their server
- This happens BEFORE any JavaScript runs
- Service workers can't modify navigation requests
- All client-side spoofing is ignored by server-side detection

## ✅ Final Recommendation
Deploy this solution that:
1. Honestly explains the €21 mobile pricing issue
2. Guides users to enable desktop mode (the real fix)
3. Provides a test page to verify it's working
4. Offers alternative methods as backup
