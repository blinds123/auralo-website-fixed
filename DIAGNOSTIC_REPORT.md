# Live Site Diagnostic Report
Date: June 26, 2025 22:35 UTC

## PHASE 1 ANALYSIS COMPLETE

### Current Live Site Status:

#### ✅ WORKING CORRECTLY:
1. **Carousel Navigation Buttons** 
   - Buttons ARE side-by-side on mobile (as requested)
   - Style matches desktop (50x50px, rounded corners)
   - Located at lines with inline styles

2. **Blue Dots (Hotspots)**
   - All 8 hotspots ARE visible
   - Opacity: 1, Display: block, Position: absolute
   - 2 dots per image in "Your Life Elevated" section
   - Data confirmed: hotspot-1 through hotspot-8

#### ❌ NOT WORKING:
1. **14-Second Timer Popup**
   - `window.forceXLPopupOnAllPlatforms` is UNDEFINED
   - No timer is starting
   - No popup appears

### Version Analysis:
- Page Title: "You Are Not For Everyone - $20" (production version)
- No debug elements present
- Last commit shows v4.0 but timer fix from latest commit NOT deployed

### Root Cause Investigation:
- WebFetch shows the function IS defined as `window.forceXLPopupOnAllPlatforms` in the HTML
- But browser console shows it as undefined
- This suggests a JavaScript execution error or timing issue

### Possible Issues:
1. JavaScript error preventing the script from executing
2. Script loading order problem
3. The function is defined but in a scope that gets cleared
4. Browser console was checked before the script loaded

## Next Steps:
1. Check Netlify deployment status
2. Force clear cache and redeploy
3. Verify webhook connection between GitHub and Netlify
