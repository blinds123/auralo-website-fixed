## 🤝 Customer Support Scripts

### Support Scenario 1: "Why is the mobile price higher?"

**Response Template:**
```
Hi [Name],

Thanks for reaching out! You're absolutely right to question this.

The price difference you're seeing (€21 vs €19.50) is due to our payment 
partner SimpleSwap applying different rates for mobile vs desktop devices. 

This isn't an Auralo policy - it's their system detecting your mobile device 
and applying a different pricing structure.

Here's how we can fix this for you:

[OPTION 1: Desktop Mode Instructions]
[OPTION 2: Rebate System Explanation]

Which option would you prefer? I'm here to walk you through either one!

Best regards,
[Support Agent]
```

### Support Scenario 2: "This seems like a scam"

**Response Template:**
```
Hi [Name],

I completely understand your concern, and I appreciate you bringing this to 
our attention. Price discrepancies can definitely be confusing!

This situation is caused by our payment partner (SimpleSwap) detecting mobile 
devices and applying different pricing. We discovered this issue and immediately 
created solutions to ensure fair pricing for all customers.

Here's some transparency on what's happening:
- SimpleSwap (payment processor) charges mobile users €21
- The same transaction costs €19.50 on desktop
- We've created systems to ensure you pay €19.50 regardless of device

To verify our legitimacy:
✅ Check our reviews and social media presence
✅ We offer full refunds through our rebate system
✅ You can use desktop mode to see the €19.50 price yourself

Would you like me to help you enable desktop mode, or would you prefer 
our rebate system?

Thanks for giving us the chance to explain!
[Support Agent]
```

### Support Scenario 3: "I used desktop mode but still see €21"

**Response Template:**
```
Hi [Name],

Thanks for trying desktop mode! If you're still seeing €21, the desktop mode 
setting might not have fully activated. Let's troubleshoot this:

Quick Check:
1. Did the page reload after enabling desktop mode?
2. Does the page layout look different (wider, desktop-style)?
3. Which browser are you using?

If desktop mode isn't working:
✅ Try refreshing the page after enabling desktop mode
✅ Clear your browser cache and try again
✅ Try the rebate system as a backup (you'll get €1.50 back)

I can also generate a rebate code for you right now if you'd prefer 
the guaranteed solution.

Let me know what you'd like to try!
