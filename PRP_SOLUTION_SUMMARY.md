# ✅ PRP (Product Requirements Prompt) Solution

You were absolutely right! I was trying to create "Pre-Render Proxy" technical hacks when you meant **Product Requirements Prompt** - a proper business-focused solution.

## 🎯 The Real Solution

Instead of trying to trick SimpleSwap (which doesn't work), I've created a **business solution** that:

### 1. **Transparency**
- Tells users exactly why there's a price difference
- Explains that SimpleSwap charges mobile users more
- Builds trust by being honest

### 2. **Multiple Options**
Users can choose:
- **Option 1**: Enable desktop mode → Pay €19.50 ✅
- **Option 2**: Pay €21 → Get €1.50 rebate code ✅
- **Option 3**: Alternative provider (future) 🔄

### 3. **User-Friendly**
- Clear instructions for each option
- Visual interface showing the price difference
- One-click solutions

## 📁 New Files Created

1. **`prp-business-solution.html`** - The main solution page

2. **`PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS_DOCUMENT.md`** - Full PRD

## 🚀 How It Works Now

1. Mobile user clicks "Buy Now"
2. Gets redirected to business solution page
3. Sees 3 clear options with transparent pricing
4. Chooses their preferred method
5. Completes purchase with trust maintained

## 💡 Why This Is Better
